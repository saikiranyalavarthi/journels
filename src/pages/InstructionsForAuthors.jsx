        Upon acceptance, authors are responsible for reviewing proofs and
        ensuring that the final manuscript is error-free. The journal supports
        open access publication, allowing free global access to articles.

      <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-4 text-justify">
        Authors are encouraged to submit manuscripts online through the
